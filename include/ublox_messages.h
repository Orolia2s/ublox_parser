@section integration More details from the Integration manual

UBX-RXM-SFRBX reports the broadcast navigation data message the receiver has
collected from each tracked signal.

When enabled, a separate message is generated each time the receiver decodes a
complete subframe of data from a tracked signal. The data bits are reported as
received, including preambles and error checking bits as appropriate. However,
because there is considerable variation in the data structure of the different
GNSS signals, the form of the reported data also varies.

This document uses the term "subframe", but other GNSS data structures might use
different terms, for example, GLONASS uses "strings" and Galileo uses "pages".

@subsection sub1 Parsing navigation data subframes

Each UBX-RXM-SFRBX message contains a subframe of data bits appropriate for the
relevant GNSS, delivered in a number of 32-bit words, as indicated by @ref
word_count field.

Due to the variation in data structure between different GNSS, the most important
step in parsing a UBX-RXM-SFRBX message is to identify the form of the data. This
should be done by reading the @ref constellation field, which indicates which GNSS
the data was decoded from. In almost all cases, this is sufficient to indicate
the structure. Because of this, the following sections are organized by GNSS.

However, in some cases the identity of the GNSS is not sufficient, and this is
described, where appropriate, in the following sections. In most cases, the data
does not map perfectly into a number of 32-bit words and, consequently, some of
the words reported in UBX-RXM-SFRBX messages contain fields marked as "Pad". These
fields should be ignored and no assumption should be made about their contents.
